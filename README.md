pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App locally

**With uv:**
```bash
uv run streamlit run app/app.py
```

**With pip:**
```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:8501` (or another port if 8501 is already in use). Check the terminal output for the exact URL.

## Data Format

The app expects a Rekordbox XML collection export. You can obtain your collection export in Rekordbox under **File** â†’ **Export Collection in xml format**. Each track contains:

- **Basic Info**: Track name, artist, composer, album, genre
- **Audio Properties**: File type, size, duration, bit rate, sample rate
- **Musical Data**: BPM, key/tonality, year
- **DJ Data**: Play count, rating, date added, file location
- **Advanced**: Tempo changes, cue points with colors.

## Output

### CSV Export
All track data in tabular format, suitable for spreadsheet analysis.

### NDJSON Export
Newline-delimited JSON format, one track per line. Great for streaming processing or database imports.
